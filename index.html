              <p class="greeting">To My Love, Gabbie,</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Happy first monthsary, my love.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>
                It may just be one month on the calendar, but in my heart, it
                feels like so much more. Every day with you has been a blessing
                I'll never take for granted.
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>
                I know I can't buy you expensive gifts or be there with you
                today—and that really hurts me. If I could, I'd be by your side
                in a heartbeat.
                <em>Kahit simpleng yakap lang, okay na ako, love.</em> I may not
                have much, but everything I do have—<em>lalo na puso ko</em
                >—sa'yo lang talaga.
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>
                Sometimes I think back to the past—how I let you go before. And
                it still hurts, knowing that if things were different, we
                could've been celebrating a year or more by now. That thought
                never leaves me. But what matters now is we found our way back
                to each other. And this time, I promise I'm holding on for real.
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>
                I'm sorry if I fall short sometimes… if I make you mad, if I
                don't always show how much you mean to me. I know you deserve so
                much more, and I'm sorry if I haven't been enough. But please
                know, I'm trying. I'll always find ways to make up for my
                shortcomings—even through the smallest things—because you're
                worth every bit of it.
              </p>
              <div class="highlight-text">
                <p>
                  You are my peace, my happiness, my safe place.<br />
                  I love you so deeply, Gabbie.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                And while I can't be with you today, I'm hoping—if you're
                free—can I take you on a date tomorrow, Monday? Just us. No
                rush. Just love.
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Here's to our first month… and to many more ahead.</p>
